Context::Semiotic
=================

The context::semiotic space is for algorithms (methods; functions; procedures) which are inherently unsafe but otherwise very useful.

General rule of thumb is if it isn't a grammatically clean recursive form, it doesn't belong here.
If it's a body of code that shows up a lot and so is refactored, that's more of a user-friendly safety than anything,
and thus it likely belongs in the context::media space. The exception to the rule is if it is a semantically meaningful
non-recursive form which is unsafe, then it might be best categorized here.

If it is grammatically clean recursive but otherwise unsafe or not-necessarily-safe then it should be here.
