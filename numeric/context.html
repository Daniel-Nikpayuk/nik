The numeric restraint has hardware genres having everything to do with memory.

In an abstract sense, we build memory starting with a <em>bit</em>, followed
by a <em>byte</em> (being eight bits), and then we generalize from there with
a <em>type</em>. A type being one or more bytes, assumed to have internal
structure and procedures (class methods), but which are otherwise specific
to that exact type.

As for types, it is worthwhile splitting them up into <em>word memory</em>
types which are less than or equal to word length (currently 64 bits or 8 bytes in laptops)
in size. Next we have <em>address memory</em> types which are greater than the word length and
less than or equal to two to the power of the word length (2^{word length})---at least in theory
that is, in practice given current architectures it's often far less in size.
