Notice in the "cpp" subfiles, if they use code from each other no include macro is given. This is because
when the code is read, it is library policy to read it from the local "policy" header, and so dependencies
are resolved there. Furthermore, to accentuate this, there is no---need for---"ifndef" macro use either.

Turns out you can't actually print your "static constexpr" constants within "unit" as they return an
undefined reference. You can call them successfully within other functions though. If you want to print
them, just use the media constant function versions. This is a problem that is probably fixable, but
as of yet I have no actual need to do so. I risk leaving it as is.
