Notice in the "cpp" subfiles, if they use code from each other no include macro is given. This is because
when the code is read, it is library policy to read it from the local "policy" header, and so dependencies
are resolved there. Furthermore, to accentuate this, there is no---need for---"ifndef" macro use either.
