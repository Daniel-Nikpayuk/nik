Context: The Processor Memory.

Every abstract hardware type will have specific implementation types as media constructs to represent the context
(of these abstract types).

As for navigational access of the abstract conceptual type? The implementation types are meant to build up to
the idea of random-access <em>separators</em> as navigators, specifically sifters/filters. Such accessors have highest
entropy, but are also the computationally most complex. The first step in that direction but of simpler computational
efficiency are the types that are naturally associated with <em>iterators</em>. 

The exception to the rule are <em>builtin</em> types. As they do not support their own iterators or separators.
They get their own categorization as builtin.

Context: The Processor Memory.

C++ already has a lot of builtin grammatical support for this variety of memory through its various integer
types along with their respective operators. As such this area of the library can be streamlined more than others.
As we make use of these types throughout the library, it narratively makes sense to include these types in a natural
way into this library (for which the design has enough expressivity to do so). Thus we have the "builtin" category.
If it helps, within this category, you can think of there being a "structural" folder in which the builtin types are
already defined. As they are already part of C++, we don't actually need to define or declare them, but at least in
this interpretation we have a categorical place to code any procedures or template functions we need to make use of
in the remainder of the library.

Otherwise Conceptually we start with the hardware memory bit. Associated with it is the <em>iterator</em> of the
processor category.  In practice we know a bit cannot actually be separated from a byte. Regardless, let's pretend
it can from a user-interface design, but knowing in implementation---under the hood---we will be using the builtin
C++ support.

Next we have the <em>unit</em>, which views the processor as a whole and associates the processor's <em>separator</em>
with it.

Extending the bit with its iterator, we have the <em>vector</em>.
