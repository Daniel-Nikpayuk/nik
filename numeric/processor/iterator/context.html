Context: The Processor Memory.

Conceptually we start with the hardware memory bit. Associated with it is the <em>iterator</em> of the
processor category.  In practice we know a bit cannot actually be separated from a byte. Regardless, let's pretend
it can from a user-interface design, but knowing in implementation---under the hood---we will be using the builtin
C++ support.

Extending the bit with its iterator, we have the <em>vector</em>.
