Context: The Processor Memory.

Every abstract hardware type will have specific implementation types as media constructs to represent the context
(of these abstract types).

As for navigational access of the abstract conceptual type? The implementation types are meant to build up to
the idea of random-access <em>separators</em> as navigators, specifically sifters/filters. Such accessors have highest
entropy, but are also the computationally most complex. The first step in that direction but of simpler computational
efficiency are the types that are naturally associated with <em>iterators</em>. 

The exception to the rule are <em>builtin</em> types. As they do not support their own iterators or separators.
They get their own categorization as builtin.
