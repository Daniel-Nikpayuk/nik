  Functional code is compile time oriented, but it's also meant to be generic.
  Given the nature of C++ compile time template grammar, a few compromises had to be
  made to achieve this effect. Notably we use a "base" container and any actual container
  (within structural) is then a wrapper for this base. The generic algorithms act on this base.

  We have 3 styles of implementation available to us here. The first is to work directly
  with the parameter packs.

	Strengths:

	Generic as it does not require information about the eventual container.
	Type safe as the parameter type is still specified.

	Weaknesses:

	Parameter pack must be at the end.
	Only one parameter pack allowed.

template<Parameter first, Parameter... params>
struct car
{
	static constexpr Parameter value = first;
};

  Second is to use pattern matching.

	Strengths:

	Type safe as the container type must be specified.
	Pattern matching allows for relaxed parameter pack constraints, improving expressive capabilities.
	Pattern matching allows access to the structure directly without assumed equivalent internal methods.

	Weaknesses:

	Increased redundancy as the container type must be specified for each container,
	even when the code is otherwise the same.

template<typename List>
struct car;

template<Parameter first, Parameter... params>
struct car<list<first, params...>>
{
	static constexpr Parameter value = first;
};

  Third is to use generic containers.

	With this exact example this appears cyclical, or simply unnecessary, but for more complicated algorithms
	such as Quicksort, it becomes more practical.

	Strengths:

	Generic as the container type is arbitrary, only assumed in an object-oriented way to possess the proper
	methods.

	Weaknesses:

	Grammatically tedious requiring use of many "typename" and "template" keywords to resolve ambiguity.
	Does not provide direct access to internal elements decreasing expressivity and potential optimization at times.

template<typename List>
struct car
{
	static constexpr Parameter value = List::car;
};

  As functional is meant to be as generic as possible, we will use either pattern match
  the base type or use generic containers depending on expressive simplicity. Any type safety should be resolved
  at the object oriented level.
